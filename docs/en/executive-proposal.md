# Executive Proposal

## ARIEL — Adventist Repository for Institutional and Educational Literature

**Version:** 1.0 — March 2026
**Lead Institution:** Universidad Peruana Unión (UPeU)
**Strategic Partners:** IATec · South American Division (SAD)
**Initial Scope:** South American Division → global expansion

---

## 1. The foundation: Isaiah 29:18

!!! quote "The project name"
    In Biblical Hebrew, **Ariel** (אֲרִיאֵל) appears 6 times in the Old Testament with converging meanings: "Lion of God", "Altar/Hearth of God", symbolic name for Jerusalem. Isaiah 29 ends with this promise:

    > *"In that day the deaf will hear the words of the scroll, and out of gloom and darkness the eyes of the blind will see."* — Isaiah 29:18

    The instrument of restoration in that chapter is explicitly **the book** — knowledge made accessible. ARIEL is that book made into a network.

## 2. The problem

### 2.1 Massive scale, zero infrastructure

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph sistema["Adventist Education System"]
        U["118+ universities\n50+ countries"]
        E["163,312 students"]
        D["14,206 faculty"]
        P["5K–15K publications/year"]
    end

    subgraph brecha["Current Gap"]
        R["< 6 operational\nrepositories (~5%)"]
        F["Zero federated\nnetwork"]
        I["Invisible production\nin global indexes"]
        M["No denominational\nOA policy"]
    end

    sistema --> brecha

    style sistema fill:#1a4a7a,color:#fff
    style brecha fill:#7b1a1a,color:#fff
```

### 2.2 Systemic dependency on a single institution

Currently **10 of the 20 top users** of Andrews University's Digital Commons are other Adventist universities. The rest of the system has no own infrastructure and uses Andrews as a proxy.

!!! danger "Systemic risk"
    If Andrews University changes its policy or platform, the visibility of all global Adventist scientific production collapses. Production from Africa, Asia, and Latin America — in Spanish, Portuguese, French, Swahili, Bahasa — has no dedicated platform.

## 3. The solution: ARIEL

### 3.1 Platforms ARIEL aggregates

```mermaid
graph TD
    HUB["⭐ ARIEL HUB\nariel.sciback.com"]

    DSpace["📚 DSpace\nInstitutional repositories\nTheses · Articles · Reports"]
    OJS["📰 OJS\nAcademic journals\npublished by Adventist institutions"]
    GLAM["🏛️ DSpace GLAM\nHeritage collections\nMuseums · Archives"]
    CRIS["🔬 DSpace-CRIS\nResearchers · Projects\nFunding (Phase 3)"]
    Indico["📅 Indico\nConference proceedings\n(Phase 2)"]

## 4. The 7 evidence-based arguments

=== "Scale"
    **118+ universities in 50+ countries** with 163,312 students and 14,206 faculty represent the world's second largest private education system — with zero digital infrastructure integrating their scientific production.

=== "Gap"
    Only **~6 institutions** have identifiable repositories out of 118+. Adoption rate **below 5%**, far below global average.

=== "Invisibility"
    Between **5,000 and 15,000 academic publications annually** in the Adventist system are inaccessible to Scopus, WoS, OpenAlex, and other Adventist researchers.

=== "Validated models"
    OpenAIRE (193M records), LA Referencia (5M records), CRRA/Atla, and BETH demonstrate that **federated denominational networks are technically feasible** and generate measurable value.

=== "Regulatory pressure"
    Peru (Law 30035), Colombia (Resolution 0777/2022), Brazil (CAPES OA) mandate interoperable repositories. ARIEL allows compliance with national regulations **and** global connectivity in one move.

=== "Denominational opportunity"
    The General Conference **has no open access policy**. ARIEL can catalyze the first formal Adventist policy, aligned with the Budapest, Berlin, and Bethesda Declarations.

=== "Rankings impact"
    Webometrics Transparent Ranking measures repositories directly. Without federated infrastructure, Adventist universities face **documented competitive disadvantage** in QS, THE, and Scimago.

        UPeU["🏛️ Universidad Peruana Unión\nUPeU — Lima, Peru\nInstitutional project leader"]
    end

    subgraph tecnologia["Technology Partner"]
        IATec["⚙️ IATec\nAdventist Technology Institute\nSAD official tech arm\n40+ countries"]
    end

    subgraph denominacional["Denominational Endorsement"]
        SAD["✝️ South American Division\nInstitutional endorsement\nChannel to GC"]
    end

    subgraph operador["Technical Operator"]

    subgraph universidades["Content Nodes"]
